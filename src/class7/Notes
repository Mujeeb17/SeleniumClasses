Tables
    - tables on a website use <table> tagname
    - <thead> is the first row of the table
    - <tbody> holds every other row in the table which are <tr>
    - it is possible that the first row is included in <tbody>

    - 3 levels of access:
        - whole table (but it will be in a single String)
        - row level access (all rows in the table are stored individually)
        - column level access (all columns in the table are stored individually)
    - the major difference is the Xpath
