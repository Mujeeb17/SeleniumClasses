Components of selenium
    - Selenium IDE (v1) (didn't support programming languages)
    - Selenium RC (v2) (supported programming languages but was slower)
    - Selenium WebDriver (v3) ---> (v4.x) (what we are learning)
    - Selenium Grid

Open source tool
    - it is visible to public
    - it is customizable
    - you can contribute
    - open source doesn't mean it's free

Free License Tool
    - doesn't mean its open source
    - everyone can use it (like Selenium)

- Selenium doesn't support UNIX operating systems
- Selenium supports multiple programming languages

W3C
    - The same way World Health Org. has rules and standardization for
      health and safety requirements, the W3C is like the same thing for the
      world wide web
    - stands for "World Wide Web Consortium"

- Selenium doesn't validate tests it only automates the application
    - when we want to validate things, we are going to have to
      write java code like if conditions on our own
    - this means Selenium is not a test automation tool, its just an automation tool

- the drivers (chromedriver) facilitates the code
