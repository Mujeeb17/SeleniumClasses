DOM = when you 'inspect' a website (document object model)
Web Element = everything you see on a website

to take a look at the code thats actually making a web element when inspecting
- click top left icon and then highlight the web element

in selenium when we need to find a certain web element we should use locators

why do we need locators
    when we need to find a particular web element we use locators

Locators
- there are 8 locators we can use
    - id, name, class, Tagname, xpath, linktext, partialLinkText, CSS
    - (you can see these all as methods after ".findElement(By.)"

    - to use linktext, when we inspect, there must be a link and there must be text
      and inside the method parameters, we must pass the text

    - to use partialLinkText, the condition is the same but inside the method parameters,
      we don't HAVE to pass the full text, we are allowed to pass a part of the text

    - to use Tagname, all you need is the tag but this is very prone to being duplicated
      so this one is better when we need to find multiple web elements

why are there so many locators
    - sometimes there could be a locator with a duplicate value (we shouldn't use those)
    - sometime the developers might not provide you with all the locators

Important things when selecting a locator
    - if a attribute has a number in it, it's better to avoid that and use a different
      locator because those numbers might be dynamic meaning they could change (You should
      want to use an attribute that final and works all the time)

Note:
    - any <a> tag in html code means there is a link somewhere in there
    - if you want to search things when you inspect on google, press ctrl+f
    - id attribute should always be unique
    - class attribute can have multiple values
