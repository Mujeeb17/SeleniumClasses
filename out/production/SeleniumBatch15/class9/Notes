- Tables with pagination
    - tables have more than one pages. (clicking on page 2 to see more entries)

- Approach:
    - get all the values of the table on first page
    - look for desired id
    - if found, click the checkbox, else, continue till all values are checked
    - if all values are checked but still not found, click on next page and repeat

Stale element exception
    - possible reasons: page refreshed, element was discarded

- js executer is used for things like:
    - scroll
    - drag and drop
    - click
    - highlight certain WebElements

    - always use executeScript() method
    - script is code that is going to be exceuted in js.

Actions Class
    - sometimes a regular click won't work on selenium so there are more options like Actions Class (or js executor)
    - has way more options when interacting with a site like
        - click and hold
        - double click
        - move your cursor to a specific element (hovering your mouse)
        - right click (use contextClick() method)
    - Actions class is mostly used for performing mouse actions

    - ALWAYS use perform() at the end of a line

- when we want to upload a file, use sendKeys() method
    - this only works when the tag name in the DOM for the element is <input>

Screenshots
    - There is an interface called TakesScreenshot which provides
      getScreenshotAs method and which selenium uses to take screenshot.

    - So to take screenshot of the page we have to cast our driver object to TakesScreenshot interface type:
      TakesScreenshot scrShot =(TakesScreenshot)webdriver;

      Note: casting is a process of converting 1
      dataType/objectType to another
