DOM = when you 'inspect' a website (document object model)
Web Element = everything you see on a website

to take a look at the code thats actually making a web element when inspecting
- click top left icon and then highlight the web element

in selenium when we need to find a certain web element we should use locators

why do we need locators
    when we need to find a particular web element we use locators

Locators
- there are 8 locators we can use
    - id, name, class, Tagname, xpath, linktext, partialLinkText, CSS
    - (you can see these all as methods after ".findElement(By.)"

    - to use linktext, when we inspect, there must be a link and there must be text
      and inside the method parameters, we must pass the text

    - to use partialLinkText, the condition is the same but inside the method parameters,
      we don't HAVE to pass the full text, we are allowed to pass a part of the text

why are there so many locators
    - sometimes there could be a locator with a duplicate value
    - sometime the developers might not provide you with all the locators

Important things when selecting a locator
    - if a attribute has a number in it, it's better to avoid that and use a different
      locator because those numbers might be dynamic meaning they could change (You should
      want to use an attribute that final and works all the time)

Note:
    - any <a> tag in html code means there is a link somewhere in there
