Why do we need to do testing
    - eliminates bugs
    - ensures products are good quality

What is Selenium
    - its a tool that helps you test websites automatically
    - it supports popular browsers like chrome, firefox, safari, edge
    - also supports diff languages like Java, Python, C# ect.

"Please verify that you're human" verification on websites
    - this is a protection against automation tools (like selenium)

difference between get() and navigate()
    - they both allow us to open a website
    - navigate() is also ables to go back/forward/refresh whereas get() can't do that
    - get() will wait until the whole webpage has loaded but navigate() will not wait

difference between close() and quit()
    - close() will close the current tab only
    - quit() will close the whole browser/window
