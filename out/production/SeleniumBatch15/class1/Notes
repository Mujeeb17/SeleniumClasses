Why do we need to do testing
    - eliminates bugs
    - ensures products are good quality

What is Selenium
    - its a tool that helps you test websites automatically
    - it supports popular browsers like chrome, firefox, safari, edge
    - also supports diff languages like Java, Python, C# ect.

"Please verify that you're human" verification on websites
    - this is a protection against automation tools (like selenium)

*****Every project that is created has to be configured with JAR files and drivers.*****

difference between get() and navigate()
    - they both allow us to open a website
    - navigate() is also ables to go back/forward/refresh whereas get() can't do that
    - get() will wait until the whole webpage has loaded but navigate() will not wait

difference between close() and quit()
    - close() will close the current tab only
    - quit() will close the whole browser/window

Steps to opening a website:
    1. System.setProperty -> set the path to chrome driver
    2. create instance of WebDriver
    3. use .get("url") or .navigate().to("url") -> to open the website

Become good at seeing errors as a tester
    error: the driver executable doesn't exist at the path .......
        - means your path to the driver (setProperty()) is not set up correctly

- Selenium doesn't support UNIX operating systems
- WebDriver interface extends SearchContext interface
- RemoteWebDriver implements WebDriver
- EdgeDriver and ChromeDriver extends ChromiumDriver
    - note because we are using an older version of selenium (3. something),
      this relationship won't show on IntelliJ, but it will if you
      check the Selenium Github because thats the latest version
