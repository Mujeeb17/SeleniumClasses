CSS locator
    - Xpath and css are most common locators
    - when inspecting on google, ctrl+f also checks css locators
    - Syntax:
        tagname[attribute = 'attribute value']

    - they good thing about css locator is that there are also shortcuts
       for certain atrributes
        -for ex:

        classname attribute: tagname[classname = 'value']
        shortcut: tagname.value

        Id attribute: tagname[id = 'value']
        shortcut: tagname#value

    - note in css selector, we don't have the option of getting an element by text
      like we are able to with Xpath

    - css locator syntax for using contains method:

      tagname[attribute *= 'partial value of attribute']
      (* means contains)

    - css locator also has starts-with method
      syntax: tagname[attribute ^= 'starting attribute value']
      (^ means starts-with)

    - css locator also has ends-with method
      syntax: tagname[attribute $= 'ending attribute value']
      ($ means ends-with)

WHY WE NEED THREAD.SLEEP AFTER CREATE NEW ACCOUNT
    - if we didn't have the sleep method, java will give us error saying element doesn't exist.
      1st step to this error, check that your locator is correct using google inspect ctrl+f

      2nd step, if locator is correct, you need to consider the speed because everything
      happens so fast and our code might be executed faster than the browser can load things.
      Especially when a new window pops up on the same web page.

Radio button (check boxes)
    - Ex: (male or female checkboxes)

Functions we can use in selenium
    - returns boolean: isEnabled() checks if the radio button can be selected or not(if not selectable, usually it is greyed out)
    - returns boolean: isDisplayed() checks if web element is displayed on the page or not
    - returns boolean: isSelected() checks if the radio button is selected or not

Approach for selecting one radio button out of 2 or more:
    - 1. use .findElements() and choose a locator thats common for all of them
    - 2. iterate through the list and check the value of each button
    - 3, make an if condition that selects the one you want
