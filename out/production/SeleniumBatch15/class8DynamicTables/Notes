- Tables can be static or dynamic
- static tables don't allow us to input any data or change anything

Dynamic tables
    - changes can be made to the table = dynamic
    - in terms of code, we deal with static/dynamic tables the same way but
      logic is usually different
    - never assume things when writing the code always check your logic by
      using the DOM especially with loops
